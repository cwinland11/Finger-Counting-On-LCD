# Finger-Counting-On-LCD
This project uses a camera and a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures and display the corresponding number on an LCD screen. The camera captures images of your hand gestures, and the model predicts which number you are holding up. The predicted number is then sent to an Arduino board, which controls the LCD screen to display the number.

The top line of the LCD shows the predicted number (e.g., "Number: 5"). This project combines computer vision, machine learning, and hardware (Arduino and LCD) to create an interactive and fun way to learn about image recognition and microcontroller programming.

Personal Notes: I was going to add the confidence percentage to the bottom row of the LCD, but I couldn't get it to work, any ideas would be appreciated.
